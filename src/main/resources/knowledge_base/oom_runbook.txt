ISSUE: JVM_OOM_LEAK. 
The symptoms are high heap usage (approaching 100% of -Xmx) and the presence of "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" 
in logs. JFR will show high allocation rates and low free memory. The fix involves identifying the class causing 
the leak (e.g., MemoryResource) and then increasing the pod's memory request/limit or the JVM's -Xmx flag.
