ISSUE: HIGH_CPU_UTILIZATION. 
The symptoms are high pod CPU usage (over 80% of request limit) and slow response times. 
JFR analysis will show the top consuming method (e.g., CpuResource.triggerCpuSpike) and CPU time spent in RUNNABLE state. 
The fix is to scale the application or introduce a kill switch/limit on the offending loop.
